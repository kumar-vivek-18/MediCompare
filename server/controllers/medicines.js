        "how_it_works": "Pantom DSR Capsule is a combination of two medicines: Domperidone and Pantoprazole. Domperidone is a prokinetic which works on the upper digestive tract to increase the movement of the stomach and intestines, allowing the food to move more easily through the stomach. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) which works by reducing the amount of acid in the stomach which helps in the relief of acid-related indigestion and heartburn.",

This enzyme breaks down the antibiotics and makes them ineffective. As a result, the bacteria become resistant to the antibiotic being used for treatment. Enoxy CV Suspension comprises two active ingredients, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. While clavulanic acid stops the enzyme from rendering amoxycillin ineffective, amoxycillin works towards killing the tuberculosis-causing bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective treatment for resistant tuberculosis.",

If your child vomits the medicine within 30 minutes of intake, let the child calm down and repeat the dose. Do not double dose if it's the time for the next dose.Enoxy CV Suspension may cause vomiting, diarrhea, nausea, abdominal pain, and allergy. These side effects should diminish on their own. But, in case they persist or start bothering your child, you must not delay speaking to your child’s doctor.

Tell your doctor about any other medicines your child is taking before starting Enoxy CV Suspension. Also, check with your child’s doctor before giving any medicine to your child.| Q. Can I get my child vaccinated while on treatment with Enoxy CV Suspension?::: Antibiotics usually do not interfere with the ingredients in vaccines or cause a bad reaction in a child who has just been vaccinated. However, children taking antibiotics should not get vaccinated until they recover from the illness. As soon as your child feels better, the vaccine can be given.| Q. Which lab tests may my child undergo while taking Enoxy CV Suspension on a long-term basis?::: With prolonged therapy, the doctor may monitor kidney and liver function tests periodically to keep a check on your child’s condition.| Q.

If your child experiences increased severity of symptoms, please consult your doctor for re-evaluation.| Q. Can I stop giving Enoxy CV Suspension to my child when the symptoms are relieved?::: No, do not stop giving this medicine to your child unless the full course of the treatment is complete, even if you feel better. The symptoms may improve before the infection is completely cured. Hence, continue giving the medicine for the due course as it may still be showing beneficial effects.| Q. Can the use of Enoxy CV Suspension cause diarrhea?::: Yes, Enoxy CV Suspension may cause diarrhea. It is an antibiotic that kills harmful bacteria. In addition to that, the medicine may also affect the helpful bacteria in your child’s stomach and cause diarrhea. In case of diarrhea, encourage your child to drink plenty of water or other fluids. Talk to your doctor if diarrhea persists and you notice any signs of dehydration, like less frequency of urination with dark colored and strong-smelling urine. Do not give any other medicine to your child without consulting a doctor.| Q. Do all viral common colds result in secondary bacterial infection?::: Most of the time, bacterial infections do not follow viral infections. In fact, giving antibiotics in viral infection can increase your child’s risk of developing side effects. So, use antibiotics only after consulting with your child’s doctor.| Q. The mucus coming out of my child’s nose is yellow-green. Is it a sign of a bacterial infection?::: Yellow or green mucus in the nose does not mean that antibiotics are needed. During a common cold, it is normal for mucus to thicken up and change from clear to yellow or green. Symptoms often last for 7-10 days.| Q. Is there any sign which shows that my child needs immediate medical attention?::: You must call your child’s doctor right away if your child experiences serious allergic reactions (breathing problems, skin rashes), gastrointestinal infections (diarrhea), and liver damage (weakness, paleness, vomiting). Though rare, these side effects are serious and need an expert’s attention.",
        "how_it_works": "Enoxy CV Suspension is an antibiotic. It has two active agents, amoxycillin and clavulanic acid. Amoxycillin works by preventing the formation of the bacterial protective covering (cell wall) essential for the survival of the bacteria. Whereas, clavulanic acid serves a special purpose of inhibiting an enzyme (beta-lactamase) that is produced by resistant bacteria. This makes the combination of amoxycillin and clavulanic acid an effective line of treatment for many types of infections.",

You should take it exactly as it is prescribed for it to be effective.Some simple lifestyle changes can help reduce the symptoms of GERD.
